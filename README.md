#### What is it?

Using the BLE caberQU is straightforward. Simply connect your USB-C cable to both sides of the device. The BLE caberQU applies a voltage across all the pins to test if they transmit the voltage to the opposite end. With 24 pins in a USB-C connector, plus an extra for the shield, the device uses LEDs to represent each pin's connectivity, giving you a visual indication of the cable's capabilities.
But the BLE caberQU takes things a step further with its LCD and integrated Bluetooth connectivity. The device offers detailed information about the connected cable, including wire resistance, connected pins, USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) marker readout, and more.

#### Features and Screens

The BLE caberQU provides valuable insights through its intuitive interface:
    • First Screen: Overview
        ◦ Data Speed: Displays the maximum speed the cable can support, limited by physical pin connections or marker specifications.
        ◦ Charging Power: Calculates the maximum charging power based on cable resistance and specifications.
        ◦ Cable Health: Assesses cable integrity by analysing resistance and pin connections, alerting you to any shorts or issues.
    • Second Screen: Specs
        ◦ USB Data Versions: Indicates available USB standards like USB 2.0, USB 3.0, USB 4, and others.
        ◦ Maximum Voltage: Shows the highest voltage the cable can handle, from the default 5V up to 48V.
        ◦ Amperage: Displays the maximum current, influenced by cable resistance and eMarker data.
        ◦ USB Connector Pins: Visual graphic representing the number of connected pins out of the 24 available, helping you understand the cable's potential.
    • Third Screen: Details
        ◦ It provides all cable parameters in text form, including eMarker data, BLE caberQU hardware and software versions, and its unique ID (UID).

#### Companion App

The BLE caberQU app, available for both Android and iOS devices, enhances your experience by offering greater detail and functionality. Through the app, you can:
    • Access an online database of manufacturers for more comprehensive cable information.
    • Receive firmware updates to keep your BLE caberQU up to date.
    • Store previous measurements for future reference.
    • Read a full digital manual and learn more about USB modes and capabilities.
    
#### Easy Power Supply and Use
To power your BLE caberQU, simply connect it to any USB-C power source—be it a laptop, charger, power bank, or USB outlet. There's no need for batteries, eliminating concerns about limited lifespans or planned obsolescence. The device is designed for longevity and sustainability.

#### Cable Plug Direction
You can plug the connectors of the cable under test in any orientation. Flipping them will change the displayed pins, offering a complete analysis of the cable's wiring. However, it's important not to connect the power supply to the measurement ports, as this could damage the device.

#### Sustainability and Repairability
